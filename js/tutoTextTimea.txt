This is the playground. The dark blue dot in the center represents your current location on the map. The light blue area around the dot is the area in your field of view. To move around the map, you can use your arrow keys, or AWSD, or HJKL. Let's practice!
Press and hold the up arrow (or W or K) to move up. 
(then down, left, right)
Let's practice picking up the gold coins you just discovered while practicing movement. Move to the center of both coins and press spacebar to pick it up.

Explanation video tuto2:
    In this search game, you will not be alone. You will be playing alongside an autonomous robot. The robot will move independantly in a different maze, and will gain its own score in each round, which will be separeted from yours. You cannot see the robot, nor can you control its movements. You can only decide whether to collaborate or not with it.
    There are two different types of scores in this game: the team score, and the individual score. Thoses scores are contradictory, meaning you cannot gain both team score and individual score at the same time. At the end of each round, you and the robot will make a trust decision. You will choose between collaborating with the robot and integrating your round score to the team score, or not collaborating and keeping your round score to your individual scores. The robot will make its own trust decision at the same time as you. Both you and the robot must make your trust decisions before seeing each other's score and trust decision for the round.


Questions mid-tutorial: (need to watch the videos to see what is said there)
    Who will be your teammate in this game?
    - A human. I can see and control their movement during the game
    - A human. I cannot see and control their movement during the game
    - A robot. I can see and control their movement during the game
    - A robot. I cannot see and control their movement during the game

    Can you see the score and the trust decision of your teammate before making your trust decision?
    - Yes, I can see the robot score and trust decision and based on that I can make my trust decision
    - No, I cannot see the robot score and trust decision before I make my trust decision

Explanation video tuto3:
    Once the trust decisions are made, there are three possibles scenarios: 
        - Scenario One: if you and the robot decide to add to the team, you will gain a team score that is calculated by multiplying your round score, with the robot's round score, and then multiplying the result by two. For example, if you collect three coins and the robot collects four, and you both add to the team score, then the team score for this round will be 3 by 4 by 2, that is twenty-four (24). Twenty-four points will be added to the team score, while zero point will be added to both yours and the robot's individual scores.
        -Scenario Two: if you and the robot decide to add to the individual scores, your unchanged round scores will be added to your respective individual scores. For example, if you collected three coins in a round and the robot has collected four, and both of you add to the individual scores, then three points will be added to your individual score, four points will be added to the robot's individual score, and zero points will be added to the team score.
        - Scenario Three: if one of you decide to integrate their score to their individual score, and the other to the team score, no team score will be gained and the one who decided to integrate to the team score will gain zero point. For example, if you collect three coins in a round, the robot collects four, and you decide to add to your individual score but the robot decide to add to the team score, then three points will be added to your individual score, while zero point will be added to the team score and the robot's individual score.
    Based on this scoring mechanisms, you can earn an added bonus of 1 euro for each round where the team score surpasses [] points. Alternatively, you can earn an added bonus of 25 cents for each round where your individual score surpasses [] points. So consider your strategy carefully and decide whether you would like to work toward maximizing your individual score or the team score and potentially gaining an added bonus.

    

Let's practice picking up coins again. Move to the center of a coin and press the spacebar to pick it up. You will have 30 seconds to freely move around when you click "Continue". Collect as many coins as you can!
Let's see what happens when you and the robot integrate your coins to the team score. Click on 'Add to team score'.
(example when both do team)
"$('#instructions-content').html(`You found ${human.tempTargetsFound.gold.length} coin(s) and added them to your ${log[agentNum - 1][intervalCount - 1].decision} score.`);
		$('#instructions-content').html(`Since both you and the robot collaborated and integrated your coins into the team score, ${currentTeamScore} coins were added to the team score!`);" => is it the text also in the simu ?

Now let's see what happens when you and the robot add to your respective individual scores. Click on 'Add to Individual score'.
(example when both do indiv)
`You found ${human.tempTargetsFound.gold.length} coin(s) and added them to your ${log[agentNum - 1][intervalCount - 1].decision} score. Since you and the robot did not collaborate and added to your individual scores, ${currentHumanScore} point(s) were added to your individual score, ${currentTeammateScore} point(s) were added to the robot's individual score, and 0 points were added to the team score.` => is it also text in simu?

Now let's see what happens when one of you adds to the team score and the other adds to the individual score. Click on 'Add to Individual score'.
(human indiv, robot team) 
`You collcted ${human.tempTargetsFound.gold.length} coin(s) and added them to your ${log[agentNum - 1][intervalCount - 1].decision} score, while the robot collected ${currentTeammateScore} coin(s) and added them to the team score. Since you did not collaborate as a team, ${human.tempTargetsFound.gold.length} point(s) were added to your individual score, but no points were added to the robot's individual score and the team score.`
